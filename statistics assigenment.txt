
Answer 1 :-                     
ˉ
𝑥 = 520
σ = 100
n= 25
Confidence level = 80%
ME=z(n
σ)=1.28(25
100)=1.28(5
100)=1.28×20=25.6
CI=520±25.6
So, the 80% confidence
interval about the mean is:
(494.4,545.6)


 Answer 2:-
^
p = 
170/
250
=0.60
p0 = 0.60
n= 250
calculate the satatity
z= 
250
0.60×(1−0.60)
​
 
​
 
0.68−0.60

𝑧
=
0.08
0.60
×
0.40
250
z= 
250
0.60×0.40 
0.08
𝑧
=
0.08
0.24
250
z= 
250
0.24
0.08
𝑧
=
0.08
0.00096
z= 
0.00096
0.08
𝑧
=
0.08
0.031
z= 
0.031
0.08
𝑧
≈
2.58
z≈2.58
​ ABC is greater than 60%.

Answer 3:-
Rank= 100 99×(N+1)
    (N=20)
Rank=100 99×(20+1)
   =20.79
The 20th data point is 12, 
and since there is no 21st data point, 
the 99th percentile is 
           =12
Answer 4:-
if the distribution of data is skewed to the left,
the mean is less than the median, which is often less than the mode.
If the distribution of data is skewed to the right,
the mode is often less than the median, 
which is less than the mean. ​
